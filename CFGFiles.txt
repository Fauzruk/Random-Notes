The way I understood what *.cfg files are was :
A usable represantation of an emulator's / some program's disk storage. Kind of like how you are able to run VM's 
without partitioning the disk , but keeping files and stuff in one folder (with one or more files - which are not
the stored ones) which is used as the disk storage
