I prefer eclipse kepler in Ubuntu/Linux (and I am not doing any C/C++ development on windows any more ,
I have not tried on a mac). You need to download the CDT after downloading eclipse (it's a plugin , tons of tutorials 
out there!).GCC Compiler FTW!



scanf("%type", *type);
printf("%type..." , type...);
