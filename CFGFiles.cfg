The way I understood what *.cfg files are was :
A usable represantation of an emulator's / some program's disk storage. Kind of like how you are able to run VM's 
without partitioning the disk , but keeping files and stuff in one folder (with one or more files - which are not
the stored ones) which is used as the disk storage.

So , if your game has missing files , be sure to download the correct version of parent roms and cfg files!

Fun fact * JD uses cfg files for some reason 

Anyway , file extension doesn't mean anything in particular , so it can also be used as a java properties file
(cfg = config for short)
