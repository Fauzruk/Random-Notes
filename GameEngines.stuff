So several good gameengines have been under development for years and I still thing triple A titles should stick with Unreal or 
so but , if you are an indie developer , grab a library and start creating...There are several advantages:
1)No limitations (It may come with a little time cost but you can do EVERYTHING)
2)You know what every bit does
3)No stuff that are not neccesary
4)No licensing and fees and stuff
5)Can do with all languages
6)Let the community mod your game
