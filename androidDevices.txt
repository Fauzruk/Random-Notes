If adb devices is not showing your device , try fastboot devices.
You may also want to manually reboot to bootloader if there are issues.
fastboot oem unlock is too easy, don't be afraid to try it.

FUCK YOU PEOPLE THAT MESS AROUND WITH ANDROID'S IMAGES AND YOUR OEM STUFF! THIS IS REDICULOUS! WHY NOT INCLUDE PLAY STORE,
NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO RUN LATEST ANDROID AND NOT FUCKING EVEN INCLUDE A GOD DAMN MANUALLY - ACCESIBLE RECOVERY/BOOTLOADER 
MODE??????

Just rooted my Nexus 7 and put cyanogenmod. It is amazing.
Just rooted my Optimus L3 and it sucks. Not fucking easy to unlock the bootloader!
