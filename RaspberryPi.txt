This one is for raspberry pi. I am getting one soon and want to tell you some stuff:

- Don't think you will get the berry and then you are done. You need a case (min.5$), a keyboard (min.10$),
  a mouse (min.10$), HDMI/RCA/3.5mm Audio Jack cables (I bet you can get an RCA/3.5mm Audio Jack one for free if 
  you go to the right place...),a powersupply, either if it is a portable battery or a pluggable-to-wall 
  device(min.15$). A must-have is the SD card(depends what you want! - I reccomend a 16GB Class 10 one) 
  Optional stuff regarding the GP I/O pins: Some jumper wires 
  (Male to Male , Male to Female , Female to Female), a Mosfet-H 
  bridge expand chip(min.10$), a wireless -> USB device(can be preeety small min.(7$)), 
  Heatsinks(You don't actually need them , but it's good to have some min.3$),
  External storage(Cheaper than the SD card, can be very smaller. I have a 16GB Cruizer Fit),
  Breadboard(Circuit stuff).
  
- You can do hell too many things with such a thing! Use it as your home server , as a media player , as a very tiny
  and portable computer, and even use it's pins to transmit to FM frequencies , make it an RC device, make it a
  router and much much more(look @ forums!)
  
- Don't be afraid of the whole programming python + other stuff concept. Code is readable and the APIs are really
  easy and fun to mess with! I'm sure you will get the hang of it quickly...
  
- The community is fucking big. no jokes...

- It doesn't seem that a model C is going to be released soon.

- Sandisk SD cards are the most supported cards and they also offer a great variety to use. And it's quality is good too! 

- If you are going to use a USB Hub , be sure it is 2.0 (not 3.0 or 3.5, to avoid compatibility issues) and it is
  getting power from an not-raspberry source.
