Random-Notes
============

Random notes on anything , but mainly programming!
Useful stuff , things I want/need to remember, tips , hints , random stuff , problems that I have faced and do not want to be faced again + more!

Things not to do if you are an IT guy:
- Sleeping late
- Smoking
- Getting drunk
- Spend way too much time debugging

Super amazing source for video tutorials:
