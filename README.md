============

Random notes on anything , but mainly programming!
Useful stuff , things I want/need to remember, tips , hints , random stuff , problems that I have faced and do not want to be faced again + more!

Things not to do if you are an IT guy:
- Sleeping late
- Smoking
- Getting drunk
- Spend way too much time debugging
- Study/Learn too many stuff a day. You will forget most of them, don't do it!
- Try to learn something quickly. Dude... it takes time!
- Have low self-confidence
- Never waste a day without revising something you have forgot or learn something new!
- Don't be afraid to try out new stuff, it may seem hard at first , but you will get the hang of it, soon!

Control + Space in eclipse is veeeeery useful!
